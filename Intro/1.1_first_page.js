//  - greatly simplifies the tasks commonly involved with creating modern web
//    that are highly interactive and responsive
//  - browser agnostic
//  - code syntax is nice and compact
//  - works on sets of elements, not just individual ones
//  - uses a concept called statement chaining to reduce the amount of code
//  -  JQuery is also highly extensible with plugins

// JQuery leverages many of the skills you already have as a web developer
//  - CSS syntax to find and retrieve page content
//  - also uses JavaScript syntax

// First Page //
// 1. link to the jQuery library that we downloaded earlier.
// 2. set up an event listener to trigger when the DOM of the page is loaded.
// 3. inside the event handler, we'll use jQuery to insert some content into the
//    webpage, indicating that jQuery has properly loaded and is working correctly.
