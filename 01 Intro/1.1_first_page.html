<!--
JQuery is one of the most widely-used open-source JavaScript libraries
 - greatly simplifies the tasks commonly involved with creating modern web
   that are highly interactive and responsive
 - browser agnostic
 - code syntax is nice and compact
 - works on sets of elements, not just individual ones
 - uses a concept called statement chaining to reduce the amount of code
 -  JQuery is also highly extensible with plugins

JQuery leverages many of the skills you already have as a web developer
 - CSS syntax to find and retrieve page content
 - also uses JavaScript syntax

First Page //
1. link to the jQuery library that we downloaded earlier.
2. set up an event listener to trigger when the DOM of the page is loaded.
3. inside the event handler, we'll use jQuery to insert some content into the
   webpage, indicating that jQuery has properly loaded and is working correctly.


 $("document").ready(function() {
   $("#content").append("<p>The page just loaded.</p>");
 });

'$'               jQuery function calls the jQuery library
'("document")'    keyword indicates that we're about to perform an
                  operation on the page itself
'ready( ...'      fn that sets up an event listener for when just the DOM
                  structure of the page is fully parsed by the browser
'(function() {'   callback function is the event handler that will be fired when
                  the ready event is triggered
 '$("#content")'  jQuery function to perform an operation on the element in the
                  page that has the id of "content"
'.append()'       fn function appends a piece of content to the tag that we
                  passed to the jQuery function
